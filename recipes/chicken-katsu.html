    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch
        thickness
      </li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour,
        beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken
        breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press
        into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the
        hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer
        to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
      </li>
    </ol>
