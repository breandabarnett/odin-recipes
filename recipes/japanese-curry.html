    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Japanese curry is easily one of the top national dishes of Japan, behind
      sushi, ramen, and miso soup. It is distinctly Japanese, varying enough
      from Indian or Thai curries to be its own. Making Japanese curry in the
      Instant Pot® ensures the texture is perfect, and the meat, if used, is
      tender and juicy. What I was taught growing up: always, always use the
      roux as a base. Serve with rice!
